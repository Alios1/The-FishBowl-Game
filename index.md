Get ready for some fun with the FishBowl Game! It's like charades and a secret word game had a fabulous baby!

And thanks to a sprinkle of Artificial Intelligence magic. Say goodbye to repeating the same old phrases over and over!

Gather your crew and split into two teams for 3 action-packed rounds of excitement.

Here's the lowdown on the rounds:

1. Description: Describe the contents of the card without saying any words found on it.
2. Charades: Act in any way you can to describe the contents of the card, remember you can't talk!
3. Clue: You can only use one word as a clue for your team to guess the card.\nThe player cannot change the word in that same turn so choose your clue carefully!

Remember, these are the golden rules, but feel free to toss in your own twists during the 3 rounds of epic fun!

Ready to dive in? Let the games begin and may the odds be ever in your favor!
